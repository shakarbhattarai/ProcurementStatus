There are many public procurement projects that are awarded to different companies each year. Some projects get completed in time while other goes on for years and in some cases decades. So our idea is to analyze the data available to us and create a web interface that shows the companies that participated in these public procurement projects and track their progress to visualize them on the basis of effectiveness. We also list all the unawarded projects for public to view and track them.
Another part of our idea is to crowdsourcing which involves using tweets to view the status of different projects. People will us a certain keyword as #hashtag to tweet photos of some project which would be updated in our web app.
